**We are happy to update the pre-release of the CPACS Creator to Version 0.2.0**

This update includes an update to the recent release of TiGL 3.4.0 and hence is compatible to CPACS 3.4.

## Installation

The pre-release is available as a conda package. We recommend installation into a clean conda environment

```bash
conda create -n cpacscreator python=3.11 cpacscreator -c dlr-sc
```


CPACS Creator was developed by *Malo Drougard* at [CFS Engineering](https://cfse.ch/) as an extension of the TiGLViewer.

You can find the documentation [here](pages/documentation). **Enjoy!**
