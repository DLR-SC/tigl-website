This christmas mesh consists of 1,089,988 Quads and 371,916 Triangles.
It demonstrates our new hanging node resolving feature developed by Florian Becker in his <a href="https://elib.dlr.de/187499"> Master's thesis</a> - soon to be integrated into the t8code main branch.
The image was created with our <a href="https://github.com/dlr-amr/png2mesh">png2mesh</a> library. See also the <a href="https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8data/tree/main/png2mesh/ChristmasCard2022"> t8data repository </a> if you want to recreate the mesh.
